# mymind library

A Windows-first, local-first visual library for saving and rediscovering ideas, images, articles, notes, PDFs, quotes, and other things worth remembering.

The product treats search and associative memory as the organizing system instead of requiring users to maintain folders and metadata. Content is captured quickly, understood in the background, and retrieved through search, visual browsing, semantic connections, and automatically updated Spaces.

## Status

Early development. The browser preview uses seed data, while the Tauri runtime reads and writes the local SQLite library.

- **Working:** URL capture with article extraction (Defuddle + fallback), file picker, drag-and-drop, clipboard, screenshot, and browser-extension capture, SQLite storage with FTS5 search, thumbnail generation, safe embed allowlists, the background job queue, PDF text extraction with scanned-page OCR on Windows, and local text/image embeddings.
- **In progress:** semantic and visual search and Smart Spaces. The current embedding backend is a deterministic local feature encoder; a learned ONNX model can replace it behind the same job and storage boundary after model selection.

The browser-extension handoff is a `mymind://capture?url=<encoded-http-url>` deep link; the extension itself can remain a separate package.

## Stack

- Tauri 2 for the Windows desktop shell
- React, TypeScript, and Vite for the interface
- Bun for JavaScript dependencies and scripts
- Rust for the native application core
- SQLite and FTS5 for local storage and full-text search
- Windows.Media.Ocr for native image OCR on Windows
- Defuddle for readable article extraction
- Local deterministic text and image feature embeddings, with an ONNX model boundary reserved for the next model-selection milestone
- llama.cpp for optional local summaries and structured analysis (next milestone)

## Development

Install dependencies:

```powershell
bun install
```

Start the desktop development app:

```powershell
bun run tauri dev
```

Build the web frontend:

```powershell
bun run build
```

Run the ingestion smoke tests:

```powershell
bun run ingest:smoke
```

Run the AI and extraction benchmark harness:

```powershell
bun run bench
```

Check the Rust application:

```powershell
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

## Direction

The current technical slice accepts an image, URL, or PDF; creates a card immediately; stores local assets; extracts articles with Defuddle; and indexes titles, descriptions, metadata, and image OCR text with SQLite FTS5. Image OCR runs in a persisted background job and can be searched after processing finishes.

The remaining first-milestone work is learned embedding model selection, semantic and image-similarity search, and saved Smart Spaces.

The application is designed for Windows first while keeping the frontend and domain boundaries portable enough for a future web version.
